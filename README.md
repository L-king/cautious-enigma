#Cautious Enigma
##Latin Grading and Assessment Tool

This project aims to make a responsive web app in polymer to help assess middle school latin students.

The app will consist of two datasets: questions and answers.

It will also have 4 views:
1. Adding questions
2. Taking tests
3. Grading
4. Viewing grade


We'll be using firebase to hold the questions as well as the answers, linked to the students' google account for authentication.
